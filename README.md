## noise-feedback
Based on the file used in [this video](https://youtu.be/HlafwGDvmPc) and requested by 毛润发.
A noise feedback system taken from a [Generative Design](https://docs.derivative.ca/Generative_Design) example that featured GLSL noise particle system (M_1_5_02). This file will soon be deprecated as it uses GLSL 1.2, thus the code needs to be ported for future use.
